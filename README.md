Thanks for reading!

The Repo is organized as follows:
- Jupyter notebooks starting with numbers: numbers indicate steps completed for this project, in logical order
- `presentation-final.mp4` is the presentation video
- The `slides-project` file contains slides for the presentation
- Adjuncts (pictures, html files): html files are **interactive** and available here on [my personal website](https://zixuanzzx01.github.io/posts/migration-patterns/). Feel free to explore them!
