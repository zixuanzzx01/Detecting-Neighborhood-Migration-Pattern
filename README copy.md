Thanks for reading!

The Repo is organized as follows:
- Jupyter notebooks starting with numbers: numbers indicate steps completed for this project, in logical order
- `presentation-final.mp4` is the presentation video
- The `slides-project` file contains slides for the presentation
- Adjuncts (pictures, html files): html files are **interactive**. Feel free to check on it!
